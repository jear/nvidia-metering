KubeLogExporter CronJob

The KubeLogExporter cron job needs to fulfil the following requirements:

    It needs to run every hour
    It needs to be successful, e.g. no error when reading or storing a log occurs
    It needs the use the service account that we discussed in the last article to have the proper access rights to namespaces, pods and logs
    It needs to use a persistent volume to store the log files, so that independent of the actual node where the job runs the same log files are amended
